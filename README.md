# MyWebsite
This is my main [**alimad.co**](https://alimad.co) homepage!!!

There are a couple of subdomains of the site that I've worked on; The extra folder contains some small extra sites that im too lazy to create a separate repo for. Open a folder to view the deployment instructions.

---

`@` is deployed from the `/main` folder. 

`/activity` contains the local C# worker that runs on my pc. It logs all sorts of activity bcz yes :P

Watchin me do stuff is allowed, taking screenshots when something interesting shows up is allowed, but try to save all the data into massive log files is something I'd say you better not do :3c

`/websocket` contains the websocket server the worker connects to to share data, apart from that the websocket (`ws.alimad.co`) has a channel based communication system, which can be used to make chatting apps easily.
