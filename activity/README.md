# Alimad LogWays

LogWays is a spyware that runs in the background on your computer. Uploads your keypresses, active window, screenshots and other stuff to a websocket. Alimad runs this because he is stupid and also because it looks cool. Please create your own websocket if you want to use this. Check https://github.com/Alimadcorp/websocket for that.

Remember to update your password in Passwords.cs
